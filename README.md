# Bone-Pickaxe-Mod
A mod for Better Than Wolves that adds new tools to the game. 

This project is essentially a port of Super Better Than Wolves! The aim is to make SBTW compatible with other addons. For example, Bone Pickaxe Mod can be played with Deco, Better Terrain, and Sock's Crops. Pre-2.0, it was also compatible with Yany's Stuff & Things.
