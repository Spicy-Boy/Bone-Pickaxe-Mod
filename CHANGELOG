                :D



CHANGELOG V2.0

TODO: DETECT IF DAWN MOD IS INSTALLED TO PREVENT CRASH
        > Check SCDecoIntegration.java

- Added a config option (see BPM.properties in the config folder) for placing tools with right click (rather than ctrl+right click)
    TODO: Multiplayer type beat???

- Added Hardcore Soaked, a change that makes sleeping under a rain storm less possible

- Added Hiracho's Dynamic Lighting addon for the sake of the server modpack!
        > Torches will emit light when held in the hand. Perfect for exploring the deep places of the world!
        > DL is disabled by default in the BPM config. Enable it by changing the configuration option to true
        
- Added two new bed roll crafting recipes involving feathers and unknit wool. Woo accessible sleeping bags!
        
- Added the crafting table back to the creative menu

- Changed (reduced) the chance of branches dropping from decaying leaves significantly. From my brief tests, a tree may drop just two branches now

- Tweaked hunger system so that the player can jump and move around longer before being imobilized by hunger. (can jump during famished)

- Tweaked hunger system so that the player starves to death when hunger bar is empty more slowly in general.
        
- Tweaked sleeping code internally to backport bug fixes from newer versions of CE

- Tweaked the position of the wake up button (nudged upward) so that status can be viewed while laying down

- Fixed (by backporting) the lighting bug that caused furnaces and hampers to appear pitch black

- Fixed a crash that caused your save to brick if you attempted to piston shovel ash!

***
CHANGELOG V 1.2

- Updated the mod to support CE 1.4.1 (sweet dreams!)

- Added the iron knife, a sharper, more durable knife

- Added recipes to return knives to your inventory if they are being used to cut something

- Added recipes for cracking open ribs using axes, it's faster than cutting in a pinch

- Changed flint knapping to match the system in SBTW. You are now allowed 3 bad hits before the flint shatters and blinds you

***
CHANGELOG V 1.1:

- Fixed issue where knives did not break webs properly

- Fixed issue where THE DEATH CLUB wasn't in the mod

- Fixed issue where leaves did not drop branches on decay

***
CHANGELOG V 1.0:

- Added new cow drop: beef rib
    >can be cooked in an oven or in a pan

- Added new item: the rib bone
    > can be acquired by cutting a hunk of beef rib    
    
- Added new tool: the bone pickaxe
    > crafted from a cow's rib bone
    
- Added old block: the workbench/crafting table
    >crafted with an iron ingot and 8 planks
    
Added new tool type: knives
NOTE: can't add proper animations without editing the player class, so those are left out in this version
    >crafted with flint + stone 
    > can carve wood, cut branches, cut hemp, carve ribs, cut leather
    > can stab things with them
    
Added new leather armor and tanned leather armor recipes using cut leather
    > Leather can be cut with knives (new progress recipe, like knitting!)
    > recipes fit within the 2x2 inventory crafting grid

Added old tool: the stone hoe  
    
Added new item: branches
    >can be dropped by leaves, generated on forest floor
    >can be used to craft primitive tools
    
Added Hardcore Bible Murder
    
Added the MEAT CUBE!  

Added the TIME CUBE!

Changed pigs to always drop 2 pieces of meat when killed

    >armor rendering recipes have been adjusted accordingly

Changed pork to render into 2 tallow
