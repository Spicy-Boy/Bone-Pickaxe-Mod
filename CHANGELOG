CHANGELOG V2.0

TODO: - Added a new bedroll recipe: wool knit + wool knit + wool (unknit) / 2x feather for stuffing

TODO: - Fixed/backported a fix for a bug that caused fireworks to crash the game.

TODO: - Fixed the lighting bug that caused hampers and such to look completely pitch black (thanks Dawn, Hiracho, and the CE team!!!)

TODO: - Fixed a game bricking bug that created a ticking tile entity or something when using a piston shovel to pick up ash.

TODO: - Added config/side mod to placing tools (the old way, rather than ctrl+click

TODO: DETECT IF DAWN MOD IS INSTALLED TO PREVENT CRASH
        > Check SCDecoIntegration.java

- Added Hardcore Soaked, a change that makes sleeping under a rain storm less possible

- Added Hiracho's Dynamic Lighting addon for the sake of the server modpack!
        > Torches will emit light when held in the hand. Perfect for exploring the deep places of the world!

- Changed (reduced) the chance of branches dropping from decaying leaves significantly. From my brief tests, a tree may drop just two branches now

- Tweaked hunger system so that the player can jump and move around longer before being imobilized by hunger. (can jump during famished)

- Tweaked hunger system so that the player starves to death when hunger bar is empty more slowly in general. 
        
- Tweaked sleeping code internally to backport bug fixes from newer versions of CE

- Tweaked the position of the wake up button (nudged upward) so that status can be viewed while laying down

***

- Added recipes to return knives to your inventory if they are being used to cut something
