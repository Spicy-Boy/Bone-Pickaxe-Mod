CHANGELOG V2.0

        >https://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?t=9873&start=25
        >Big shout out to Yany, creator of amazing addons
        
TODO- Add config for branch dropping maybe? Or just disable it, who knows

- Tweaked hunger system so that the player can jump and move around longer before starving.
- Tweaked hunger system so that the player starves slower in general 
TODO: DETECT IF DAWN MOD IS INSTALLED TO PREVENT CRASH
        > Check SCDecoIntegration.java

CHANGELOG V 1.2

- Updated the mod to support CE 1.4.1 (sweet dreams!)

- Added the iron knife, a sharper, more durable knife

- Added recipes to return knives to your inventory if they are being used to cut something

- Added recipes for cracking open ribs using axes, it's faster than cutting in a pinch

- Changed flint knapping to match the system in SBTW. You are now allowed 3 bad hits before the flint shatters and blinds you

***
CHANGELOG V 1.1:

- Fixed issue where knives did not break webs properly

- Fixed issue where THE DEATH CLUB wasn't in the mod

- Fixed issue where leaves did not drop branches on decay

***

Added new leather armor and tanned leather armor recipes using cut leather
